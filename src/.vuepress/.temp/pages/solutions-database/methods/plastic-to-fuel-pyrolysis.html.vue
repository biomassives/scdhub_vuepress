<p>Plastic to fuel pyrolysis is a process in which plastics are heated in the absence of oxygen, causing them to break down into smaller molecules that can be used as fuel. While this process can be an effective way to recycle plastic waste and reduce its environmental impact, not all types of plastics are safe to use in a pyrolysis system.</p>
<p>In general, plastics that contain chlorine, fluorine, or other halogens should be avoided in pyrolysis systems, as they can release toxic chemicals when heated. It is important to carefully select the types of plastics used in pyrolysis processes and to properly dispose of any plastic waste that cannot be safely recycled in this way.</p>

<p>Many types of plastics that are commonly found in the waste stream contain chlorine, fluorine, or other halogens. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>PVC</b> (polyvinyl chloride) - often used in construction materials, plumbing pipes, vinyl flooring, and other products</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>PVDC</b> (polyvinylidene chloride) - often used as a barrier coating on food packaging, such as meat and cheese packaging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>PTFE</b> (polytetrafluoroethylene) - often used in non-stick coatings on cookware, as well as in electrical insulation and other applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>PFOS</b> (perfluorooctane sulfonate) is another type of plastic that is unsafe to use in pyrolysis. PFOS is a type of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS), which are highly persistent and can accumulate in the environment and in living organisms. When PFOS-containing plastics are heated in a pyrolysis system, they can release PFAS compounds into the environment, which can have serious health and environmental impacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>PFOA</b> (perfluorooctanoic acid) - often used as a surfactant in the production of certain plastics, including PTFE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>CFCs</b> (chlorofluorocarbons) - used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, as well as in aerosol sprays and other applications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of plastics can release harmful gases and other substances when heated or burned, making them a major source of pollution and health hazards in the waste stream. It is important to properly identify and separate these types of plastics from other materials in the waste stream, and to recycle or dispose of them in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
