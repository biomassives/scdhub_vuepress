<template><div><p>Chlorination is a process used to disinfect drinking water and make it safe for consumption. In chlorination, chlorine is added to the water to kill bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can cause illness. Chlorine is a powerful disinfectant and is widely used in drinking water treatment due to its effectiveness and relatively low cost.</p>
<p>Chlorination can be done at the treatment plant, or at the point of use (POU), depending on the size and complexity of the water system. It is important to maintain the correct chlorine residual in the water to ensure its safety and quality, and to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>Here is a case study of drinking water chlorination:</p>
