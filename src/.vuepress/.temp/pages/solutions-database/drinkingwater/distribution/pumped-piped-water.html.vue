<template><div><p>Piped water distribution systems are networks of pipes that transport treated drinking water from treatment facilities to homes and buildings. The water is typically treated at a centralized facility to remove contaminants and ensure that it is safe to drink. The treated water is then stored in a reservoir or tank, from which it is pumped through the distribution system to homes and buildings through a network of pipes. The pipes are typically buried underground, although some may be above ground in certain areas. The water is delivered to homes and buildings through taps, faucets, or other outlets. These systems are designed to ensure a consistent and reliable supply of safe drinking water to communities. The distribution system is typically maintained by a government agency or water utility, which is responsible for ensuring that the water is clean and safe to drink and that the pipes and other components of the system are in good working order.</p>
