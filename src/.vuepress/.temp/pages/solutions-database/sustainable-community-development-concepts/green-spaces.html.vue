<p>Green spaces have been a significant aspect of sustainable community development in Kenya. Over the years, various efforts have been made to create green spaces in urban and rural areas to improve the quality of life for the community and the environment.</p>
<p>One of the notable people who have championed efforts to create green spaces in Kenya is Wangari Maathai, who founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977. The Green Belt Movement is a non-governmental organization that focuses on planting trees, conserving the environment, and empowering communities to manage their natural resources sustainably.</p>
<p>Another notable person is Simon Maina, who founded the Community Based Environmental Management (CBEM) program. The CBEM program aims to promote community-based natural resource management, including the creation of green spaces and the protection of wildlife habitats.</p>
<p>Current efforts to create green spaces in Kenya include various initiatives by the government, non-government organizations, and community-based organizations. The government has established several national parks and reserves to protect wildlife habitats, as well as initiated several urban greening programs to create parks and open spaces in cities.</p>
<p>Private sector companies and non-government organizations are also partnering with communities to create green spaces through tree planting initiatives, conservation efforts, and community-based programs.</p>
<p>Historically, funding for green space initiatives in Kenya has come from a variety of sources, including the government, international organizations, and private sector companies. Volunteer efforts have also been critical in supporting these initiatives, with many individuals and organizations lending their time and resources to support the creation and maintenance of green spaces.</p>
<p>The intrinsic benefits of green spaces include improved air quality, reduced carbon emissions, and increased biodiversity. Extrinsic benefits include increased property values, improved health outcomes, and enhanced community pride and social cohesion.</p>
<p>In terms of new projects proposed, there is ongoing interest in creating green spaces in urban areas to address the impacts of rapid urbanization and to promote sustainable community development. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to expand and protect national parks and wildlife habitats to conserve biodiversity and support ecotourism.</p>
<h2 id="united-states" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#united-states" aria-hidden="true">#</a> United States</h2>
<p>The United States has a long history of creating green spaces for sustainable community development. Beginning in the late 19th century, cities and towns across the country started to establish parks and other public green spaces as a way to improve the quality of life for residents.</p>
<p>One of the most notable champions of green space creation in the United States was Frederick Law Olmsted, a landscape architect who designed many of the country's most famous urban parks, including Central Park in New York City and Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the trend of creating green spaces continued, with many cities and towns establishing parks, gardens, and other public green spaces. However, the growth of cities and the increasing demand for land also brought new challenges, such as urbanization and the loss of green spaces to development.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, there have been a number of successful efforts to create and preserve green spaces in the United States. These efforts have been funded through a variety of sources, including government grants, private donations, and corporate sponsorships.</p>
<p>Volunteer efforts have also played a critical role in the creation and maintenance of green spaces. For example, community organizations and local residents often come together to clean up parks, plant trees, and maintain community gardens.</p>
<p>The intrinsic benefits of green spaces in the United States include improved air quality, reduced carbon emissions, and increased biodiversity. Extrinsic benefits include increased property values, improved health outcomes, and enhanced community pride and social cohesion.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in creating green spaces in the United States, driven in part by the recognition of the many benefits that these spaces provide. There are currently several new green space initiatives underway, including the creation of new urban parks, the expansion of existing parks, and the establishment of community gardens and other green spaces in under-served areas.</p>
<p>Overall, the history of green space creation in the United States is a story of ongoing efforts to improve the quality of life for residents and to promote sustainable community development. Despite the many challenges that have arisen over the years, the commitment of individuals, organizations, and communities to creating and preserving green spaces has remained strong, and will likely continue to be a critical part of the country's sustainable development efforts in the future.</p>
<h2 id="china" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#china" aria-hidden="true">#</a> China</h2>
<p>Green spaces have been an important aspect of sustainable community development in China, and there have been various efforts to create and maintain them over the years. One of the earliest examples is the &quot;Green Great Wall&quot; project, which was initiated in the 1970s to combat desertification and promote green spaces in northern China.</p>
<p>However, the development of green spaces has faced various challenges in China, including land degradation, rapid urbanization, and a lack of political will and funding. Despite these challenges, there have been several notable individuals who have championed the cause of green spaces, including environmental activists and urban planners.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a renewed effort to create green spaces in China, particularly in urban areas. For example, the Chinese government has launched various initiatives aimed at increasing the amount of green space in cities, such as the &quot;Green City&quot; program and the &quot;Green Ribbon&quot; initiative. These projects are funded through a combination of government grants, private investment, and volunteer efforts.</p>
<p>The benefits of green spaces are both intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsically, green spaces provide a peaceful and calming environment, as well as opportunities for recreation and physical activity. Extrinsically, green spaces can help improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>There are also new projects being proposed to increase the amount of green space in China. One such example is the &quot;Greenway&quot; project, which aims to create a network of green spaces and parks that would connect various cities in China. Another project is the &quot;Green Belt&quot; initiative, which aims to create a ring of green spaces around cities to provide a barrier against urban sprawl and protect natural habitats.</p>
<p>Overall, the development of green spaces in China continues to be an important aspect of sustainable community development, and there are ongoing efforts to increase the amount of green space and improve its quality.</p>

<p>Canada has a long history of creating green spaces for sustainable community development, dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when cities like Toronto and Montreal began establishing parks and recreational areas. Since then, there have been various efforts to create and maintain green spaces in Canada, ranging from local parks and community gardens to large-scale urban forest initiatives.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the development of green spaces in Canada has faced various challenges over the years.
