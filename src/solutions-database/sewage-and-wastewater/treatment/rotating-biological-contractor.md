A Rotating Biological Contractor (RBC) is a type of wastewater and sewage treatment process that uses a series of rotating disks to support a biofilm of microorganisms. The wastewater or sewage is applied to the rotating disks, and as they rotate, the microorganisms in the biofilm remove the organic pollutants and convert them into biomass, carbon dioxide, and other byproducts.

RBCs are widely used for the treatment of wastewater and sewage in a variety of contexts, including:

- Municipal wastewater treatment: RBCs are often used in municipal wastewater treatment plants to treat the wastewater generated by homes and businesses.

- Industrial wastewater treatment: RBCs are also used to treat industrial wastewater generated by factories, refineries, and other industries.

- Agricultural wastewater treatment: RBCs can be used to treat agricultural wastewater generated from livestock operations and other agricultural activities.

RBCs are an effective and efficient method for the treatment of wastewater and sewage, as they provide a large surface area for the growth of microorganisms and support a high-density biofilm. Additionally, RBCs are relatively low in cost and require minimal maintenance, making them a popular choice for treatment facilities in a variety of settings. RBCs are also simple to operate and can be adapted to a wide range of flow rates, making them a flexible solution for different types of wastewater and sewage treatment applications.
