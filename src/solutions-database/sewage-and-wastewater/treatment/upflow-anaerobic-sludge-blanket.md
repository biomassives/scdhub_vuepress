Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) is a type of anaerobic treatment process used for treating wastewater sludge. The process uses anaerobic bacteria to convert organic pollutants in the wastewater sludge into biogas, which is composed mainly of methane and carbon dioxide. The UASB process takes place in a reactor, where wastewater sludge is fed into the bottom of the reactor and is mixed with anaerobic bacteria. The biogas produced by the bacteria rises to the top of the reactor and is collected for use as a renewable energy source. The process is called "upflow" because the wastewater sludge is fed into the bottom of the reactor and the biogas rises to the top.

The UASB process is highly effective in removing organic pollutants from wastewater sludge and is commonly used in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment facilities. It is a cost-effective and sustainable solution for wastewater sludge treatment, as it reduces the volume of sludge, improves the quality of the effluent, and generates biogas, which can be used as a source of renewable energy.
