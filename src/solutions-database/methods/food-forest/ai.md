## AI to support transitioning to sustainable food systems


integrating technology into a food forest can bring many benefits. By using AI and other technologies, it's possible to monitor various environmental factors and make more informed decisions about plant care and management. For example, monitoring systems for soil moisture, temperature, and light levels can help you determine the optimal growing conditions for each plant species, allowing you to provide the right care and resources to support their growth.

Predictive analytics can also be used to anticipate and prevent disease and pest outbreaks, which can be costly and damaging to the food forest. By using data-driven models to identify patterns and trends, you can proactively implement strategies to prevent or manage diseases and pests, ensuring that your food forest remains healthy and productive.

Additionally, technology can help streamline and automate many of the manual tasks involved in maintaining a food forest, such as irrigation and pruning. This can save time and labor, and also reduce the risk of human error. Overall, the integration of technology into a food forest can help you achieve your goals of increased productivity and sustainability, and make the management of your food forest more efficient and effective.
