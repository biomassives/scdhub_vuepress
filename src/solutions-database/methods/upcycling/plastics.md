## Plastics processing systems comparison

please generate a mermaid.js markdown flowchart for inputs, outputs, condenser, vortex separator, plastics extruder, optical separation, cleaning, upcycling to new products

Here's a Mermaid flowchart that represents the inputs, outputs, and processes involved in upcycling plastics to new products:

The flowchart begins with the input of plastic waste. The plastic waste is then cleaned to remove any impurities before being subjected to optical separation. This process uses optical sensors to sort the plastic waste based on its color, type, and other physical properties.

Next, the separated plastic waste is processed through a plastics extruder, which melts and extrudes the plastic into new shapes. The melted plastic is then passed through a condenser to remove any volatile substances and stabilize the plastic.

The stabilized plastic is then subjected to a vortex separator, which separates any remaining impurities from the plastic. The final step is upcycling, where the clean, stabilized plastic is transformed into new products, such as consumer goods or building materials. These new products are the outputs of the process.


## Plastics processing by extrusion


Plastics processing by extrusion is a manufacturing process in which a plastic material is melted and formed into a continuous profile or shape. This process is commonly used for the production of plastic products such as pipes, tubes, sheets, and profiles, as well as products such as profiles, sheets, and film.

In extrusion processing, a plastic material is first melted in an extruder machine. The melted plastic is then forced through a die, which shapes the material into a desired profile. The extruded plastic is then cooled and cut into the desired length.

Extrusion processing is a high-volume, continuous process that is well suited for producing large quantities of plastic products. It is also an efficient process, as the melted plastic is continuously fed into the extruder, allowing for a continuous production of plastic products.

In addition to producing plastic products, the extrusion process can also be used to incorporate various additives into the plastic material, such as colorants, UV stabilizers, and flame retardants. This allows for the production of custom plastic products with specific properties and characteristics.



## Plastics processing by extrusion project considerations

Designing an extruder for small DIY projects and community startups focused on addressing unemployment and waste management/environmental pollution/open burn problems requires careful consideration of several key factors. These include:

    Cost: Cost is a critical factor when designing an extruder for small DIY projects and community startups. The goal is to minimize the cost of the machine while ensuring that it is functional and reliable. This can be achieved by using locally sourced and low-cost materials, and by designing the machine with ease of maintenance in mind.

    Material compatibility: It is important to ensure that the extruder is compatible with the materials that will be processed. For example, some plastics are more difficult to process than others, and the extruder design needs to be adapted to accommodate these materials.

    Capacity: The extruder should be designed with a capacity that meets the needs of the project. For small-scale DIY projects and community startups, a smaller extruder may be more appropriate, as it will be more affordable and easier to manage.

    Safety: Safety is a critical consideration when designing an extruder. The machine should be designed to minimize the risk of injury to operators, and to reduce the risk of fire and other safety hazards.

    Ease of operation: The extruder should be designed to be easy to operate, even for people with limited technical expertise. The machine should be intuitive to use, and should be equipped with user-friendly controls and displays.

    Energy efficiency: The extruder should be designed with energy efficiency in mind. This will help to reduce the operating costs of the machine, and will also help to reduce the carbon footprint of the project.

    Waste reduction: The extruder should be designed to minimize waste and to promote sustainability. For example, the machine should be designed to maximize the use of recycled materials, and to minimize the generation of plastic waste.

By taking these factors into account, a small-scale DIY extruder can be designed that is affordable, functional, and environmentally responsible. This will help to support community-led initiatives focused on addressing unemployment and waste management/environmental pollution/open burn problems.
