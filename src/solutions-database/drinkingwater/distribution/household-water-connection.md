Household water connections refer to the system of pipes, valves, and fixtures that bring potable water into individual homes for drinking and other household uses.

Examples of modes of failure in household water connections include leaks in pipes, broken valves, and clogged fixtures. Repair typically involves fixing or replacing the damaged component, while maintenance involves regular inspections and upkeep to prevent failures.

Funding mechanisms for household water connections can come from various sources such as the government, utility companies, or individual homeowners.

Expected eventualities in household water connections include regular wear and tear, aging infrastructure, and occasional failures.
