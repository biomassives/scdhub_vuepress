Chlorination is a process used to disinfect drinking water and make it safe for consumption. In chlorination, chlorine is added to the water to kill bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that can cause illness. Chlorine is a powerful disinfectant and is widely used in drinking water treatment due to its effectiveness and relatively low cost.

Chlorination can be done at the treatment plant, or at the point of use (POU), depending on the size and complexity of the water system. It is important to maintain the correct chlorine residual in the water to ensure its safety and quality, and to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.

Here is a case study of drinking water chlorination:


# Case Study: Drinking Water Chlorination

<b>Location:</b> Municipal water treatment plant in Ohio

Date: 2022

<b>Description:</b> A municipal water treatment plant in Ohio implemented a chlorination system to disinfect the drinking water and make it safe for consumption. The chlorination system was designed to meet the latest regulations and standards for drinking water treatment, and was equipped with monitoring and control systems to ensure the proper levels of chlorine in the water. The residents of the area reported improved taste and quality of the water, and were confident in its safety due to the chlorination process.


# Lessons Learned:

Chlorination is an effective and widely used process for disinfecting drinking water and making it safe for consumption.

Proper design, monitoring, and control of the chlorination system are crucial to ensure the safety and quality of the drinking water.
