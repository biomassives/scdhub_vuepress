Case Study: No-Storage Drinking Water System

- Location: San Francisco, California
    
- Date: 2021
    
- Description: A residential building in San Francisco installed a no-storage drinking water system, which treated and delivered drinking water directly to the taps without the need for storage. The system used a combination of filtration, reverse osmosis, and UV disinfection to remove impurities and contaminants from the water. The residents reported improved taste and quality of the water and no longer had to worry about the maintenance and safety of a large storage cistern.

Lessons Learned:

- No-storage drinking water systems can provide safe and high-quality drinking water without the need for storage.

- These systems are more convenient and easier to maintain compared to traditional storage cisterns.
