Solid waste disposal by bucket refers to the practice of using buckets to collect and store waste before disposing of it properly. This method is often used in households and small communities where waste management facilities are limited.

Sorting options for composting and recycling can vary based on the context and the resources available. For composting, biodegradable waste such as food scraps, yard waste, and paper can be separated from non-biodegradable waste and placed in a compost bin or pile. The compost can then be used as a natural fertilizer for plants.

For recycling, common sorting options include separating paper, plastic, glass, and metal. These materials can be taken to a recycling center or collected by a recycling service for processing and reuse. Some communities also have curbside recycling programs where residents can place recyclables in designated bins for pickup. The specific sorting options will depend on the recycling facilities available and the types of materials they can process.
