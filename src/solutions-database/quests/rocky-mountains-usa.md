evolving story of wolf re-introduction into colorado


## upstream producer responsibility.. 

  Does it mean, reduce plastics and use of plastics? more? writing letters? a retooling of factories?
  changes in how we supply one another are possible within biodynamic/organic natural production & health standards.

  ..to the average consumer, does this mean more access to bulk, new forms of commerce? really.? or just same same..?

  recycling, upcycling, food solutions, relocalizing, forest health, wildlife conservation, river 

   preservation.
   
## Ongoing
Eco Ops is just testing its usefulness at Lifespan Local, Denver, as a way to support volunteer management of the
(2) earthtubs at their food redistribution hub. 

Mamawatot Africa Webmaster Cert Class - conducted on whats app, it is a mentoring and teaching group for young adults worldwide (ideally) from communities where eco clubs, and the Eco Ops app as a teaching tool upcycle mapping and ICT for young tech learners.

'Upcycle mapping' refers to a process of working with community members to inventory assets and think about how they could be connected together more efficiently, what steps may be required to connect those places. Strategy is important for groups as well as individuals.  One goal of the Eco Ops project is to track the price of materials in different regions, and seek to verify all information well.

'use it and learn to adjust it' type of hands on open source tool easily self managed on free infrastructure.  By providing this level of empowerment to communities, we feel that SCD Hub provides an important service.
