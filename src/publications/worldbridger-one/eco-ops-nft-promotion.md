EcoCity NFT Page Functionality
Introduction
The ecocity.com/nft, exotopia.org/nft, and worldbridgerone.org/nft pages serve as dynamic interfaces where users can view their EcoCity, Exotopia, and WorldBridger One NFTs, and connect them to real-world sustainable development concepts across the SCDHub ecosystem. These pages integrate blockchain technology with educational content from SCDHub.org, creating an interactive learning experience about sustainability, climate action, and biodiversity.
Multi-Chain Support

The pages support NFTs minted on multiple blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, to provide users access to a broader range of sustainable development-themed digital assets.
Users can connect their web3 wallets supporting different blockchain networks to view and interact with their NFTs across the SCDHub ecosystem.

Collaborative Community Building

The pages encourage users to join the planning and development process for these NFT-powered sustainable initiatives.
Users can participate in coding workshops, brainstorming sessions, and community-driven projects to help build the technical infrastructure and educational content.
By inviting users to contribute their skills and ideas, the pages foster a sense of shared ownership and investment in the success of these sustainability-focused platforms.

Integrated Ecosystem

The NFT pages are seamlessly integrated with the broader SCDHub.org ecosystem, including the Ecocity, Exotopia, and WorldBridger One websites.
Users can access relevant educational resources, case studies, and sustainability-focused initiatives directly from the NFT pages, creating a cohesive learning and engagement experience.
The pages leverage the expertise and content available across the SCDHub network to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the environmental and social impact of their NFTs.

Example Use Case: Thika Eco Club
The Thika Eco Club is a community-based organization focused on improving water quality and reducing the prevalence of H. pylori infections in the Thika region of Kenya. They have decided to leverage the SCDHub NFT platform to engage their members and collaborate with other local groups.

NFT-Powered Water Quality Mapping: The Thika Eco Club members mint NFTs representing different water sources in their community. Each NFT contains metadata about the water quality, including potential contaminants like H. pylori.
Connecting with Other Groups: The club reaches out to other community organizations, such as local schools and health clinics, to invite them to connect their own water-related NFTs to the SCDHub platform. This allows them to collectively map the water quality across a broader region.
Educational Content Integration: By connecting their water quality NFTs to the SCDHub ecosystem, the Thika Eco Club members can access relevant educational resources and case studies on water conservation, sanitation, and H. pylori prevention. They can then share this information with their community to raise awareness and promote behavioral changes.
Collaborative Problem-Solving: The NFT platform enables the Thika Eco Club to collaborate with other groups to identify problem areas, share best practices, and coordinate efforts to improve water quality and reduce H. pylori infections. The community-driven nature of the platform fosters a sense of shared responsibility and empowers local stakeholders to take action.
Rewards and Engagement: The SCDHub NFT platform includes features to incentivize user engagement, such as earning rewards for contributing data, participating in workshops, or successfully implementing sustainable solutions. This helps to maintain the Thika Eco Club members' motivation and investment in the project.

By leveraging the SCDHub NFT platform, the Thika Eco Club can effectively map their local water resources, collaborate with other groups, access educational content, and foster a sense of community ownership in addressing the water quality and health challenges they face.
Technical Implementation
The technical implementation details remain largely the same as the previous version, with the following additions:
Multi-Chain Support

The pages use a multi-chain wallet integration solution, such as WalletConnect, to allow users to connect their wallets and view NFTs across different blockchain networks.
The NFT data retrieval and metadata loading processes are abstracted to handle NFTs from various chains.

Collaborative Features

The pages include sections for community participation, such as forums, event calendars, and contribution forms.
Users can submit ideas, code snippets, or educational content to be reviewed and integrated into the platforms.
The pages leverage collaboration tools, such as GitHub repositories and project management software, to streamline the community-driven development process.

Ecosystem Integration

The pages fetch and display relevant content from the Ecocity, Exotopia, and WorldBridger One websites, providing users with a seamless cross-platform experience.
API integrations with the SCDHub.org backend enable the pages to access the latest sustainable solutions outline and related educational resources.

By expanding the scope and functionality of the EcoCity NFT pages to encompass the broader SCDHub ecosystem, these platforms will become powerful tools for engaging users in sustainability-focused initiatives, fostering community collaboration, and driving positive environmental and social impact.




## Page Loading Process






### 1. User Authentication

- The page first checks if the user is logged in to their EcoCity account.
- If not logged in, the user is prompted to connect their web3 wallet.

::: tip
Consider using MetaMask or WalletConnect for easy wallet integration.
:::

### 2. NFT Data Retrieval

- Once authenticated, the page queries the blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) for NFTs owned by the user's address.
- It filters for EcoCity-specific NFTs using the smart contract address or other identifiers.

```javascript
async function getUserNFTs(userAddress) {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(ECO_CITY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, provider);
  const nfts = await contract.tokensOfOwner(userAddress);
  return nfts;
}
```

### 3. Metadata Loading

- For each EcoCity NFT, the page fetches the associated metadata.
- This metadata is typically stored on IPFS or a similar decentralized storage system.
- The metadata includes information such as:
  - NFT Name
  - Description
  - Image URL
  - Attributes (e.g., type of sustainable solution, impact metrics)

```javascript
async function getNFTMetadata(tokenId) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${TOKEN_METADATA_CID}/${tokenId}`);
  const metadata = await response.json();
  return metadata;
}
```

### 4. NFT Display

- The page renders a gallery view of the user's EcoCity NFTs.
- Each NFT is displayed with its image and basic information from the metadata.

::: warning
Ensure images are optimized for web to improve page load times.
:::

### 5. Sustainable Solution Matching

- The system analyzes the NFT's attributes and description.
- It uses natural language processing to match the NFT's theme with topics from the SCDHub.org sustainable solutions outline.
- Potential matching categories might include:
  - Renewable Energy
  - Water Conservation
  - Sustainable Agriculture
  - Waste Management
  - Green Building
  - Biodiversity Conservation

### 6. Interactive Information Display

When a user selects an NFT, the page displays:
- Enlarged NFT image
- Detailed metadata
- Matched sustainable solution topic from SCDHub.org
- Brief explanation of how the NFT relates to the sustainable solution

### 7. Educational Content Integration

- The page provides links to relevant articles, case studies, or resources from SCDHub.org related to the matched sustainable solution topic.
- Users can dive deeper into the real-world applications and impacts of the concept represented by their NFT.

### 8. User Interaction Options

Users can:
- Browse through their NFT collection
- Read about each NFT's connection to sustainability
- Access educational resources
- Share their NFT and its associated sustainable solution on social media
- Potentially earn rewards or achievements for engaging with the educational content

## Technical Considerations

- The page uses Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
- API calls to SCDHub.org are made to fetch the latest sustainable solutions outline.
- The matching algorithm uses keywords and possibly machine learning to connect NFTs with sustainability topics.
- The page is responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import App from './App.vue'
import NFTGallery from './components/NFTGallery.vue'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    { path: '/nft', component: NFTGallery }
  ]
})

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(router)
app.mount('#app')
```

## Benefits
