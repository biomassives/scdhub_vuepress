ESM NFTs are unique digital tokens that emphasize sustainable, responsible, and financially viable projects. They often represent investments, rewards, or ownership of assets linked to environmental conservation, social development, or economic growth. By financing these initiatives through ESM NFTs, stakeholders can promote a greener, more equitable world.

Biodiversity credits are a type of environmental offset that are designed to preserve or restore habitats that provide habitat for endangered or threatened species. They are often purchased by developers or other entities that have an impact on sensitive habitats, as a way to offset their impact and contribute to the conservation of biodiversity.

Climate credit NFTs are a type of NFT that represents a unit of carbon offset or carbon credit. They are used to support projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon, such as reforestation or renewable energy projects. Climate credit NFTs can be purchased by individuals or companies as a way to offset their carbon footprint and contribute to the fight against climate change.
