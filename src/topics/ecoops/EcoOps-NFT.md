Eco Ops NFTs are unique digital tokens that emphasize sustainable, responsible, and financially viable projects. They often represent investments, rewards, or ownership of assets linked to environmental conservation, social development, or economic growth. By financing these initiatives through ESM NFTs, stakeholders can promote a greener, more equitable world.

Biodiversity credits are a type of environmental offset that are designed to preserve or restore habitats that provide habitat for endangered or threatened species. They are often purchased by developers or other entities that have an impact on sensitive habitats, as a way to offset their impact and contribute to the conservation of biodiversity.

Climate credit NFTs are traditionally used as a token representing one unit of carbon offset or carbon credit sequestration per ton of CO2.  Projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon, such as reforestation or renewable energy projects are common, whereas Eco Ops emphasizes projects like ( native plant nurseries, acropian blind bird collision preventers, open trash burn solutions..) that help aid in the success of biodiversity such that habitatquality is ensured for the future, or specific threats to biodiverrsity supporting ecosystrems are addressed with creative solutions. Climate credit NFTs can be purchased by individuals or companies as a way to offset their carbon footprint and contribute to the fight against climate change at popular exchanges like moss, .
