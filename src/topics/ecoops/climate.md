## Climate Timeline

Environmental and climate issues have been presented in public space since 1900:

    1900: The Audubon Society is founded to protect birds and their habitats.
    1902: The National Park Service is created to preserve natural areas for public enjoyment.
    1935: The Wilderness Society is founded to protect wild areas from development.
    1958: The first Earth Day is held.
    1962: Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring is published, raising awareness of the dangers of pesticides.
    1967: The first United Nations Conference on the Human Environment is held in Stockholm.
    1972: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is established.
    1973: The Endangered Species Act is passed in the United States.
    1979: The Montreal Protocol is signed, phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances.
    1988: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is established.
    1992: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is adopted.
    1997: The Kyoto Protocol is adopted, setting binding emissions targets for developed countries.
    2009: The Copenhagen Accord is adopted, but fails to reach a legally binding agreement.
    2015: The Paris Agreement is adopted, setting a long-term goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
    2021: The Glasgow Climate Pact is adopted, strengthening the commitments made in the Paris Agreement.



    2009: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP15 is held in Copenhagen, Denmark. The conference fails to reach a legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it does produce the Copenhagen Accord, which is a non-binding political agreement.
    2010: The Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, causing widespread environmental damage. The spill also raises awareness of the risks of offshore drilling and the need for stronger regulations.
    2011: The IPCC releases its Fifth Assessment Report, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the science of climate change. The report concludes that it is extremely likely that human activities are the main cause of climate change.
    2012: The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) is held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The conference focuses on the need to integrate economic development, social equity, and environmental protection.
    2013: The World Bank releases its Turn Down the Heat report, which warns that climate change could have devastating impacts on the global economy. The report calls for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    2014: The IPCC releases its Sixth Assessment Report, which provides an updated assessment of the science of climate change. The report concludes that it is unequivocal that human activities are causing climate change.
    2015: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP21 is held in Paris, France. The conference adopts the Paris Agreement, which is a legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    2015: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are adopted by the United Nations. The SDGs are a set of 17 goals that aim to achieve sustainable development by 2030.
    2015: The People's Climate March is held in New York City. The march is one of the largest climate change protests in history, and it brings together millions of people from around the world to demand action on climate change.
    2015: The Green Climate Fund is established to provide financial support to developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change.

These are just a few of the many important milestones that occurred for human climate and environmental rights and awareness between 2009 and 2015. These milestones helped to raise awareness of the issue and to put pressure on governments and businesses to take action. However, there is still much work to be done. We need to continue to fight for climate justice and to ensure that everyone has access to a clean and healthy environment.

Sure, here are 20 more important milestones for human climate and environmental rights and awareness between 2015 and 2021:

    2016: The United States withdraws from the Paris Agreement.
    2017: The IPCC releases its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, which warns that limiting warming to 1.5°C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.
    2018: The Fridays for Future movement is founded by Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenage climate activist. The movement inspires millions of young people around the world to take to the streets to demand action on climate change.
    2019: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP25 is held in Madrid, Spain. The conference fails to make significant progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
    2020: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupts economies and societies around the world. The pandemic also highlights the interconnectedness of the climate crisis and other global challenges.
    2021: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP26 is held in Glasgow, Scotland. The conference adopts the Glasgow Climate Pact, which strengthens the commitments made in the Paris Agreement.
    2021: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) releases its Sixth Assessment Report, which provides an updated assessment of the science of climate change. The report concludes that it is extremely likely that human activities are causing more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2010.
    2021: The United States rejoins the Paris Agreement.
    2021: The European Union sets a target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
    2021: China pledges to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.
    2021: India pledges to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.
    2021: The COP26 Adaptation Action Framework is adopted, which aims to increase the resilience of communities to climate change impacts.
    2021: The Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero is launched, which brings together financial institutions to support the transition to a net-zero economy.

    2022: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP27 is held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The conference is expected to focus on the implementation of the Glasgow Climate Pact.

These are just a few of the many important milestones that occurred for human climate and environmental rights and awareness between 2015 and 2021. These milestones show that there is growing momentum for action on climate change, but there is still much work to be done. 


This is just a brief overview of the timeline of environmental and climate issues in public space since 1900. There have been many other important events and milestones along the way, and the issue is still evolving today.



## bold action
  - governments 
  - businesses
 

It is clear that the public awareness of environmental and climate issues has grown significantly over the past century. This is due in part to the work of scientists, activists, and organizations that have raised awareness of these issues and the need for action. It is also due to the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events that are being linked to climate change.

Despite the growing awareness of these issues, there is still much work to be done. Governments and businesses need to take bold action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Individuals can also make a difference by making changes in their own lives, such as reducing their energy consumption and driving less.

The future of the planet depends on our ability to address environmental and climate issues. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future for all.
