three major carbon sequestration technologies: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), and Direct Air Capture (DAC).

Please note that the figures provided are estimates and may vary depending on specific projects and regions.

    - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

    -- Investment cost: Approximately $60-$100 per ton of CO2 captured.
    -- Carbon captured per dollar: 0.01-0.016 tons of CO2.
    -- Carbon credits trading: CCS projects have been eligible for carbon credits since the early 2000s under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol.

    - Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)

    -- Investment cost: Approximately $100-$200 per ton of CO2 captured.
    -- Carbon captured per dollar: 0.005-0.01 tons of CO2.
    -- Carbon credits trading: BECCS has been eligible for carbon credits since the early 2010s. However, there are relatively fewer large-scale BECCS projects compared to CCS, and its potential for future carbon credits is still under exploration.

    - Direct Air Capture (DAC)

    -- Investment cost: Approximately $200-$600 per ton of CO2 captured.
    -- Carbon captured per dollar: 0.0016-0.005 tons of CO2.
    -- Carbon credits trading: DAC started gaining attention as a potential carbon credit technology around 2015, and its eligibility for carbon credits has been growing ever since.

Please keep in mind that these technologies are continuously evolving, and their costs and efficiencies may improve over time. Additionally, it's essential to 
consider other factors like geographic location, environmental impacts, and potential risks when evaluating carbon sequestration technologies.
