# EcoCity NFT Page Functionality

## Introduction

The `ecocity.com/nft` page serves as a dynamic interface where users can view their EcoCity NFTs and connect them to real-world sustainable development concepts. This page integrates blockchain technology with educational content from SCDHub.org, creating an interactive learning experience about sustainability.

## Page Loading Process

### 1. User Authentication

- The page first checks if the user is logged in to their EcoCity account.
- If not logged in, the user is prompted to connect their web3 wallet.

::: tip
Consider using MetaMask or WalletConnect for easy wallet integration.
:::

### 2. NFT Data Retrieval

- Once authenticated, the page queries the blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) for NFTs owned by the user's address.
- It filters for EcoCity-specific NFTs using the smart contract address or other identifiers.

```javascript
async function getUserNFTs(userAddress) {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  const contract = new ethers.Contract(ECO_CITY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, provider);
  const nfts = await contract.tokensOfOwner(userAddress);
  return nfts;
}
```

### 3. Metadata Loading

- For each EcoCity NFT, the page fetches the associated metadata.
- This metadata is typically stored on IPFS or a similar decentralized storage system.
- The metadata includes information such as:
  - NFT Name
  - Description
  - Image URL
  - Attributes (e.g., type of sustainable solution, impact metrics)

```javascript
async function getNFTMetadata(tokenId) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${TOKEN_METADATA_CID}/${tokenId}`);
  const metadata = await response.json();
  return metadata;
}
```

### 4. NFT Display

- The page renders a gallery view of the user's EcoCity NFTs.
- Each NFT is displayed with its image and basic information from the metadata.

Ensure images are optimized for web to improve page load times.

### 5. Sustainable Solution Matching

- The system analyzes the NFT's attributes and description.
- It uses natural language processing to match the NFT's theme with topics from the SCDHub.org sustainable solutions outline.
- Potential matching categories might include:
  - Renewable Energy
  - Water Conservation
  - Sustainable Agriculture
  - Waste Management
  - Green Building
  - Biodiversity Conservation

### 6. Interactive Information Display

When a user selects an NFT, the page displays:
- Enlarged NFT image
- Detailed metadata
- Matched sustainable solution topic from SCDHub.org
- Brief explanation of how the NFT relates to the sustainable solution

### 7. Educational Content Integration

- The page provides links to relevant articles, case studies, or resources from SCDHub.org related to the matched sustainable solution topic.
- Users can dive deeper into the real-world applications and impacts of the concept represented by their NFT.

### 8. User Interaction Options

Users can:
- Browse through their NFT collection
- Read about each NFT's connection to sustainability
- Access educational resources
- Share their NFT and its associated sustainable solution on social media
- Potentially earn rewards or achievements for engaging with the educational content

## Technical Considerations

- The page uses Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
- API calls to SCDHub.org are made to fetch the latest sustainable solutions outline.
- The matching algorithm uses keywords and possibly machine learning to connect NFTs with sustainability topics.
- The page is responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import App from './App.vue'
import NFTGallery from './components/NFTGallery.vue'

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(),
  routes: [
    { path: '/nft', component: NFTGallery }
  ]
})

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(router)
app.mount('#app')
```

## Benefits

- Gamifies learning about sustainability
- Connects digital assets (NFTs) with real-world environmental concepts
- Encourages users to engage more deeply with sustainability topics
